This performs basic sanity checks on PA's Full Voter Export (FVE) to identify invalid voters.

Run './voter-roll-checker.py' to generate the invalid voter files.

Official website for FVE (purchase required): https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/purchasepafullvoterexport.aspx
The terms of the purchase is that these files cannot be distributed, so unfortunately I cannot provide download links.
